An app to organise your wardrobe

## Getting Started

About the App:

We have developed an innovative wardrobe management app that allows users to efficiently track and organize their clothing. The app provides a clear overview of the clothes in their wardrobe, ensuring users donâ€™t make redundant purchases by buying items they already own.

Key Features:
- Strong SQL database for storing the users item details
- Strong Object Oriented Structure and SQL database for easy create , read and delete functionality.
- User friendly interface and experience.

Organized Sections:
- Wardrobe can have as many sections , cloth types and items as the user wants.

Clothes can be categorized into sections like Formal, Casual, Party Wear, and user can add more types.
Each section can have subsections for specific clothing types, including Shorts, Pants, T-Shirts, Shirts, and Accessories.


Photo Integration:

Users can take photos of their clothes or upload photos from gallery, and post them to the appropriate frames, enabling a visual catalog of their wardrobe for easier organization.
